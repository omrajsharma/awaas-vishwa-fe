# React.js and Vite Project

This is a starter project for building web applications using React.js and Vite. Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and more efficient development experience compared to traditional bundlers like Webpack. With React.js and Vite, you can build modern, high-performance web applications with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-folder
```

2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server using Vite, and your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Folder Structure

- `public`: Contains static assets that will be served as-is during development and production.
- `src`: Contains the source code for your React.js application.
  - `components`: Place your React components here.
  - `App.js`: The main entry point of your application.
- `index.html`: The HTML template used by Vite to inject your application's scripts and styles.

## Build

To build your application for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be placed in the `dist` folder.

## Deployment

You can deploy your application by serving the contents of the `dist` folder using any static hosting service or web server.
